Discovery
===========

Understand the strengths central to your core personality - what strengths are so natural to you, you may have overlooked them.  These strengths play a key role in how successful you will be. The better you understand your strengths and use them the faster you will succeed.  That is the idea behind discovery.  It's meant as a process of self-discovery. 

You will be asked a number of questions that will make you reflect and consider the way you naturally would behave.  This process will begin to illuminate what and where your strengths lie. It will also uncover your core personality type. 

The results will be clear and transparent. You decide if it is your true core personality or not.  And then you will learn and more clearly understand your strengths, what careers you should consider and why these careers play to your strenghths.  

You should walk away with the knowledge and power to know whether a career or major will play to your strengths and therefore allow you to succeed quickly or not.  

I built this in order to plug it into majorfinder.com.  Originally, it was built with the intention of being a completely separate engine that anyone could use and apply the personality test to their project.  However, to make it the best it could be it has become closely integrated with majorfinder and not a completely separate engine. 

### UPDATE (3 Sept 2014)

I am going to begin making the interface smoother with AngularJS.  You will soon see an improved interface.
