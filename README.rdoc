= Discovery

Explore your personality through a series of 50 questions.  You can see the results before completing all 50 questions but the more questions you answer the more accurate the results.  
I built this in order to plug it into majorfinder.com.  I am using it so that anyone signed up on majorfinder can answer some questions about their personality and see what majors and careers they might want to consider based on their personality.  

It is a separate engine that you could use and apply the personality test to your project in any way that makes sense for you.  

### UPDATE (3 Sept 2014)

I am going to begin making the interface smoother with AngularJS.  You will soon see an improved interface.
